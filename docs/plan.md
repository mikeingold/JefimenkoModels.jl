# TODO

- Create a branch that uses SciML IntegralProblem's

- Determine why H function is taking 3x as long to compute as E for same arguments
    - Also requires about 3x the memory/allocations, probably an integration thing
- Implement calculations for LineSource's
- Validate results of calculations

- Benchmark with sinusoidal source
- Does Ricker source induce a temporary reversion of the Poynting vector?
