# TODO

## High Priority
- Implement calculations for LineSource's
- Validate results of calculations

## Longer-Term Vision
- Try to enable automatic differentiation of solutions via SciML (IntegralProblem's)

## Performance Improvement
- Determine why H function is taking 3x as long to compute as E for same arguments
    - Also requires about 3x the memory/allocations, probably something to do with integral solver
