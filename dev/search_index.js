This solver implements a generalized version of the Jefimenko equations that enables the consideration of magnetic charges and currents, which are often a useful analytical tool in electromagnetics modeling. The solution process operates purely in the time-domain, enabling the study of wideband sources without artifacts caused by frequency-domain analysis and with reduced memory usage compared to FDTD methods.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Status","page":"Home","title":"Status","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"This package remains in development status.
